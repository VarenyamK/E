# Group E's GitHub repo for CSE 3901 projects


#All my commits for lab1 are under my name Hitesh Bavisetty but my local git repo was not conifugured to my github account.
#I have fixed this, and now my fufutre commits should be showing up with my github username instead of the default name configured with my local git repo for my lab1 commits
